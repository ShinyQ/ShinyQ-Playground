Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

## Why Docker for Web Development?

- **Consistent Environments**: Ensure your app runs the same way everywhere.
- **Isolation**: Package applications with their dependencies.
- **Simplified Dependency Management**: No more "works on my machine" issues.
- **Easy Scaling**: Scale your applications up or down easily.

## Basic Docker Concepts

- **Dockerfile**: A text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
- **Image**: A lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
- **Container**: A runtime instance of an image.

## Getting Started with Docker

1. **Install Docker Desktop** for your OS.
2. **Create a `Dockerfile`** in your project root.

   Example `Dockerfile` for a Node.js app:

   ```docker
   FROM node:18-alpine

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY package*.json ./

   RUN npm install

   COPY . .

   EXPOSE 3000

   CMD [ "npm", "run", "dev" ]
   ```

3. **Build your Docker image**:

   ```sh
   docker build -t my-node-app .
   ```

4. **Run your Docker container**:

   ```sh
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
   ```

This is a basic introduction. Docker offers much more for complex applications and microservices architectures.
