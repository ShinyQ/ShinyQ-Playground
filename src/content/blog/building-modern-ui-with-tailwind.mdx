Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without leaving your HTML.

## Why Tailwind?

- **No custom CSS needed**: Build your entire design system using utility classes.
- **Responsive by default**: Easily create responsive designs with built-in breakpoints.
- **Dark mode support**: Built-in dark mode utilities make it easy to implement dark themes.

## Getting Started

Install Tailwind CSS in your project:

```sh
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

Configure your template paths in `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,md,mdx,svelte,ts,tsx,vue}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
