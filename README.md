## üöÄ Tech Stack

This project **originally started with [lovable.dev](https://github.com/steven-tey/lovable)** as a base, but has since been **heavily rewritten, refactored, and rebuilt** into my own custom architecture.  
Now it runs on **[Astro](https://astro.build)** with React islands for interactivity and an optimized performance-first approach.
